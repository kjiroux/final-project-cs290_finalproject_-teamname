Tarot card information site.
Users start on a home page with a begin button and site title.

When the user chooses to begin, they are given a list of all the cards in the database. The cards will be displayed in a fan layout, and on mouse hover, the card is pushed up out of the deck.

The user can then click on the card to see more information about that particular card.
